    "5:4": "And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon:",
    "5:5": "and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof.",
    "5:6": "And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.",
    "5:7": "And he came, and he taketh it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.",
    "5:8": "And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.",
    "5:9": "And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou was slain, and didst purchase unto God with thy blood men of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,",
    "5:10": "and madest them to be unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon earth.",
    "5:11": "And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;",
    "5:12": "saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might and honor, and glory, and blessing.",
    "5:13": "And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things are in them, heard I saying, Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever.",
    "5:14": "And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.",
    "5:15": "and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.",
    "5:16": "If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.",
    "5:17": "All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.",
    "5:18": "We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.",
    "5:19": "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.",
    "5:20": "And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.",

    "5:24": "Some men's sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.",
    "5:25": "In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.",
    "5:26": "Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.",
    "5:27": "I adjure you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the brethren.",
    "5:28": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
    "5:29": "for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;",
    "5:30": "because we are members of his body.",
    "5:31": "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.",
    "5:32": "This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.",

    "6:6": "And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a shilling, and three measures of barley for a shilling; and the oil and the wine hurt thou not.",
    "6:7": "And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.",
    "6:8": "And I saw, and behold, a pale horse: and he that sat upon him, his name was Death; and Hades followed with him. And there was given unto them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.",
    "6:9": "And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:",
    "6:10": "and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long, O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?",
    "6:11": "And there was given them to each one a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, who should be killed even as they were, should have fulfilled their course.",
    "6:12": "And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood;",
    "6:13": "and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind.",
    "6:14": "And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.",
    "6:15": "And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;",
    "6:16": "and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:",
    "6:17": "for the great day of their wrath is come; and who is able to stand?",
    "6:18": "that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:",
    "6:19": "which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;",
    "6:20": "whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.",
    "6:21": "which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.",
    "6:22": "whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.",
    "7:1": "After his I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that no wind should blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.",
    "7:2": "And I saw another angel ascend from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,",
    "7:3": "saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we shall have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.",
    "7:4": "And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:",
    "7:5": "Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand: Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;",

    "7:9": "After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and palms in their hands;",
    "7:10": "and they cry with a great voice, saying, Salvation unto our God who sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.",
    "7:11": "And all the angels were standing round about the throne, and about the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,",
    "7:12": "saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "7:13": "And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, These that are arrayed in white robes, who are they, and whence came they?",
    "7:14": "And I say unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they that come of the great tribulation, and they washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.",
    "7:15": "Therefore are they before the throne of God; and they serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them.",
    "7:16": "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun strike upon them, nor any heat:",
    "7:17": "for the Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and shall guide them unto fountains of waters of life: and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes.",
    "7:18": "For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness",
    "7:19": "(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.",
    "7:20": "And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath",
    "7:21": "(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);",
    "7:22": "by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.",
    "7:23": "And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:",

    "8:3": "And another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.",
    "8:4": "And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.",
    "8:5": "And the angel taketh the censer; and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth: and there followed thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.",
    "8:6": "And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.",
    "8:7": "And the first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.",
    "8:8": "And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;",
    "8:9": "and there died the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, even they that had life; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.",
    "8:10": "And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of the waters;",
    "8:11": "and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.",
    "8:12": "And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.",
    "8:13": "And I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, for them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound.",
    "8:14": "but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:",
    "8:15": "as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.",
    "8:16": "But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.",
    "8:17": "For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.",
    "8:18": "And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches;",
    "8:19": "and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness:",
    "8:20": "Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us:",
    "8:21": "for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.",
    "8:22": "and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you.",
    "9:1": "And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven fallen unto the earth: and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.",
    "9:2": "And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.",
    "9:3": "And out of the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth; and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.",
    "9:4": "And it was said unto them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only such men as have not the seal of God on their foreheads.",
    "9:5": "And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when it striketh a man.",
    "9:6": "And in those days men shall seek death, and shall in no wise find it; and they shall desire to die, and death fleeth from them.",
    "9:7": "And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as it were crowns like unto gold, and their faces were as men's faces.",
    "9:8": "And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as teeth of lions.",
    "9:9": "And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots, of many horses rushing to war.",
    "9:10": "And they have tails like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to hurt men five months.",
    "9:11": "They have over them as king the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek tongue he hath the name Apollyon.",
    "9:12": "The first Woe is past: behold, there come yet two Woes hereafter.",
    "9:13": "And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,",
    "9:14": "one saying to the sixth angel that had one trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates.",
    "9:15": "And the four angels were loosed, that had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they should kill the third part of men.",
    "9:16": "And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: I heard the number of them.",
    "9:17": "And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates as of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone: and the heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceedeth fire and smoke and brimstone.",
    "9:18": "By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which proceeded out of their mouths.",
    "9:19": "For the power of the horses is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails are like unto serpents, and have heads; and with them they hurt.",
    "9:20": "And the rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk:",
    "9:21": "and they repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.",
    "9:22": "And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.",
    "9:23": "It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
    "9:24": "For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:",
    "9:25": "nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;",
    "9:26": "else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.",
    "9:27": "And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this cometh judgment;",
    "9:28": "so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.",
    "9:29": "And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.",
    "10:1": "And I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire;",
    "10:2": "and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left upon the earth;",
    "10:3": "and he cried with a great voice, as a lion roareth: and when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.",
    "10:4": "And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.",
    "10:5": "And the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to heaven,",
    "10:6": "and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are therein, that there shall be delay no longer:",
    "10:7": "but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then is finished they mystery of God, according to the good tidings which he declared to his servants the prophets.",
    "10:8": "And the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard it again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.",
    "10:9": "And I went unto the angel, saying unto him that he should give me the little book. And he saith unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.",
    "10:10": "And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.",
    "10:11": "And they say unto me, Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.",
    "10:12": "but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;",
    "10:13": "henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.",
    "10:14": "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.",
    "10:15": "And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,",
    "10:16": "This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; then saith he,",
    "10:17": "And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.",
    "10:18": "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.",
    "10:19": "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,",
    "10:20": "by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;",
    "10:21": "and having a great priest over the house of God;",
    "10:22": "let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,",
    "10:23": "let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:",
    "10:24": "and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;",
    "10:25": "not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.",
    "10:26": "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,",
    "10:27": "but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.",
    "10:28": "A man that hath set at nought Moses law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses:",
    "10:29": "of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?",
    "10:30": "For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.",
    "10:31": "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.",
    "10:32": "But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;",
    "11:1": "And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.",
    "11:2": "And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.",
    "11:3": "And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.",
    "11:4": "These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.",
    "11:5": "And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed.",
    "11:6": "These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.",
    "11:7": "And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.",
    "11:8": "And their dead bodies lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.",
    "11:9": "And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do men look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.",
    "11:10": "And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth.",
    "11:11": "And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them.",
    "11:12": "And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.",
    "11:13": "And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.",
    "11:14": "The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.",
    "11:15": "And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.",
    "11:16": "And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,",
    "11:17": "saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.",
    "11:18": "And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and the time to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.",
    "11:19": "And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.",
    "11:20": "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.",
    "11:21": "By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.",
    "11:22": "By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.",
    "11:23": "By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.",
    "11:24": "By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;",
    "11:25": "choosing rather to share ill treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;",
    "11:26": "accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.",
    "11:27": "By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.",
    "11:28": "By faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.",
    "11:29": "By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were swallowed up.",
    "11:30": "By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.",
    "11:31": "By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with them that were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.",
    "11:32": "And what shall I more say? for the time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah; of David and Samuel and the prophets:",
    "12:1": "And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;",
    "12:2": "and she was the child; and she crieth out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered.",
    "12:3": "And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.",
    "12:4": "And his tail draweth the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon standeth before the woman that is about to be delivered, that when she is delivered he may devour her child.",
    "12:5": "And she was delivered of a son, a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and unto his throne.",
    "12:6": "And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two hundred and threescore days.",
    "12:7": "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon warred and his angels;",
    "12:8": "And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.",
    "12:9": "And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world; he was cast down to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.",
    "12:10": "And I heard a great voice in heaven, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accuseth them before our God day and night.",
    "12:11": "And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of their testimony; and they loved not their life even unto death.",
    "12:12": "Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea: because the devil is gone down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.",
    "12:13": "And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that brought forth the man child.",
    "12:14": "And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness unto her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.",
    "12:15": "And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.",
    "12:16": "And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.",
    "12:17": "And the dragon waxed wroth with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, that keep the commandments of God, and hold the testimony of Jesus:",
    "12:18": "For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,",
    "12:19": "and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;",
    "12:20": "for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;",
    "13:1": "and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.",
    "13:2": "And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.",
    "13:3": "And I saw one of his heads as though it had been smitten unto death; and his death-stroke was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast;",
    "13:4": "and they worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? And who is able to war with him?",
    "13:5": "and there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.",
    "13:6": "And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, even them that dwell in the heaven.",
    "13:7": "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.",
    "13:8": "And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, every one whose name hath not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that hath been slain.",
    "13:9": "If any man hath an ear, let him hear.",
    "13:10": "If any man is for captivity, into captivity he goeth: if any man shall kill with the sword, with the sword must he be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.",
    "13:11": "And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like unto lamb, and he spake as a dragon.",
    "13:12": "And he exerciseth all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he maketh the earth and them dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.",
    "13:13": "And he doeth great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven upon the earth in the sight of men.",
    "13:14": "And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who hath the stroke of the sword and lived.",
    "13:15": "And it was given unto him to give breath to it, even to the image to the breast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.",
    "13:16": "And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead;",
    "13:17": "and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, save he that hath the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name.",
    "13:18": "Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty and six.",
    "14:1": "And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.",
    "14:2": "And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps:",
    "14:3": "and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth.",
    "14:4": "These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.",
    "14:5": "And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.",
    "14:6": "And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;",
    "14:7": "and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.",
    "14:8": "And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.",
    "14:9": "And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,",
    "14:10": "he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:",
    "14:11": "and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.",
    "14:12": "Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.",
    "14:13": "And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.",
    "14:14": "And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle.",
    "14:15": "And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.",
    "14:16": "And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.",
    "14:17": "Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.",
    "14:18": "And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.",
    "14:19": "And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress, of the wrath of God.",
    "14:20": "And the winepress are trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.",
    "14:21": "In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.",
    "14:22": "Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.",
    "14:23": "If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?",
    "14:24": "But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;",
    "15:1": "And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.",
    "15:2": "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of God.",
    "15:3": "And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.",
    "15:4": "Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.",
    "15:5": "And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:",
    "15:6": "and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure and bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.",
    "15:7": "And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.",
    "15:8": "And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.",
    "15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.",
    "15:10": "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.",
    "15:11": "Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.",
    "15:12": "Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
    "15:13": "But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:",
    "15:14": "and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.",
    "15:15": "Yea, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.",
    "15:16": "For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:",
    "15:17": "and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.",
    "15:18": "Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.",
    "15:19": "If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.",
    "15:20": "But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.",
    "15:21": "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.",
    "16:1": "And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go ye, and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.",
    "16:2": "And the first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth; and it became a noisome and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.",
    "16:3": "And the second poured out his bowl into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul died, even the things that were in the sea.",
    "16:4": "And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of the waters; and it became blood.",
    "16:5": "And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Righteous art thou, who art and who wast, thou Holy One, because thou didst thus judge:",
    "16:6": "for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets, and blood hast thou given them to drink: they are worthy.",
    "16:7": "And I heard the altar saying, Yea, O Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.",
    "16:8": "And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire.",
    "16:9": "And men were scorched men with great heat: and they blasphemed the name of God who hath the power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.",
    "16:10": "And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,",
    "16:11": "and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores; and they repented not of their works.",
    "16:12": "And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way might by made ready for the kings that come from the sunrising.",
    "16:13": "And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs:",
    "16:14": "for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.",
    "16:15": "(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walked naked, and they see his shame.)",
    "16:16": "And they gathered them together into the place which is called in Hebrew Har-magedon.",
    "17:1": "And there came one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls, and spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters;",
    "17:2": "with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and they that dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.",
    "17:3": "And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.",
    "17:4": "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her fornication,",
    "17:5": "and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.",
    "17:6": "And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.",
    "17:7": "And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and the ten horns.",
    "17:8": "The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall come.",
    "17:9": "Here is the mind that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth:",
    "17:10": "and they are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while.",
    "17:11": "And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goeth into perdition.",
    "17:12": "And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.",
    "17:13": "These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast.",
    "17:14": "These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they also shall overcome that are with him, called and chosen and faithful.",
    "17:15": "And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.",
    "17:16": "And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.",
    "17:17": "For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.",
    "17:18": "And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.",
    "17:19": "And they took hold of him, and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by thee?",
    "17:20": "For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.",
    "17:21": "(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)",
    "17:22": "And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, Ye men of Athens, in all things, I perceive that ye are very religious.",
    "17:23": "For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore ye worship in ignorance, this I set forth unto you.",
    "17:24": "The God that made the world and all things therein, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;",
    "17:25": "neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;",
    "17:26": "and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;",
    "17:27": "that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:",
    "18:1": "After these things I saw another angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was lightened with his glory.",
    "18:2": "And he cried with a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird.",
    "18:3": "For by the wine of the wrath of her fornication all the nations are fallen; and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth waxed rich by the power of her wantonness.",
    "18:4": "And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:",
    "18:5": "for her sins have reached even unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.",
    "18:6": "Render unto her even as she rendered, and double unto her the double according to her works: in the cup which she mingled, mingle unto her double.",
    "18:7": "How much soever she glorified herself, and waxed wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall in no wise see mourning.",
    "18:8": "Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judged her.",
    "18:9": "And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and lived wantonly with her, shall weep and wail over her, when they look upon the smoke of her burning,",
    "18:10": "standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.",
    "18:11": "And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buyeth their merchandise any more;",
    "18:12": "merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;",
    "18:13": "and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and merchandise of horses and chariots and slaves; and souls of men.",
    "18:14": "And the fruits which thy soul lusted after are gone from thee, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous are perished from thee, and men shall find them no more at all.",
    "18:15": "The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;",
    "18:16": "saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she that was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl!",
    "18:17": "for in an hour so great riches is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and every one that saileth any wither, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood afar off,",
    "18:18": "and cried out as they looked upon the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city?",
    "18:19": "And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, wherein all that had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.",
    "18:20": "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.",
    "18:21": "And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and shall be found no more at all.",
    "18:22": "And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft, shall be found any more at all in thee; and the voice of a mill shall be heard no more at all in thee;",
    "18:23": "and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth; for with thy sorcery were all the nations deceived.",
    "18:24": "And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all that have been slain upon the earth.",
    "18:25": "This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spake and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:",
    "18:26": "and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more accurately.",
    "18:27": "And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he was come, he helped them much that had believed through grace;",
    "18:28": "for he powerfully confuted the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.",
    "18:29": "Pilate therefore went out unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this man?",
    "18:30": "They answered and said unto him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up unto thee.",
    "18:31": "Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:",
    "18:32": "that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.",
    "18:33": "Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?",
    "19:1": "After these things I heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah; Salvation, and glory, and power, belong to our God:",
    "19:2": "for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great harlot, her that corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.",
    "19:3": "And a second time they say, Hallelujah. And her smoke goeth up for ever and ever.",
    "19:4": "And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God that sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; Hallelujah.",
    "19:5": "And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Give praise to our God, all ye his servants, ye that fear him, the small and the great.",
    "19:6": "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigneth.",
    "19:7": "Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.",
    "19:8": "And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.",
    "19:9": "And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they that are bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are true words of God.",
    "19:10": "And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren that hold the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.",
    "19:11": "And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and he that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteous he doth judge and make war.",
    "19:12": "And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems; and he hath a name written which no one knoweth but he himself.",
    "19:13": "And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is called The Word of God.",
    "19:14": "And the armies which are in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure.",
    "19:15": "And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.",
    "19:16": "And he hath on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KINGS OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.",
    "19:17": "And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid heaven, Come and be gathered together unto the great supper of God;",
    "19:18": "that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of them that sit thereon, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, and small and great.",
    "19:19": "And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army.",
    "19:20": "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought the signs in his sight, wherewith he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image: they two were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brimstone:",
    "19:21": "and the rest were killed with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, even the sword which came forth out of his mouth: and all the birds were filled with their flesh.",
    "19:22": "And having sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.",
    "19:23": "And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.",
    "19:24": "For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business unto the craftsmen;",
    "19:25": "whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business we have our wealth.",
    "19:26": "And ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:",
    "19:27": "and not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.",
    "19:28": "And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesus.",
    "19:29": "And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.",
    "19:30": "And when Paul was minded to enter in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.",
    "19:31": "And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent unto him and besought him not to adventure himself into the theatre.",
    "19:32": "Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.",
    "19:33": "And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense unto the people.",
    "19:34": "But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.",
    "19:35": "And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he saith, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?",
    "19:36": "Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.",
    "19:37": "For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.",
    "19:38": "If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.",
    "20:1": "And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.",
    "20:2": "And he laid hold on the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,",
    "20:3": "and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed for a little time.",
    "20:4": "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and such as worshipped not the beast, neither his image, and received not the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand; and they lived, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.",
    "20:5": "The rest of the dead lived not until the thousand years should be finished. This is the first resurrection.",
    "20:6": "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: over these the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.",
    "20:7": "And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,",
    "20:8": "and shall come forth to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.",
    "20:9": "And they went up over the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down out of heaven, and devoured them.",
    "20:10": "And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are also the beast and the false prophet; and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.",
    "20:11": "And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.",
    "20:12": "And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works.",
    "20:13": "And the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.",
    "20:14": "And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the lake of fire.",
    "20:15": "And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.",
    "20:16": "For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.",
    "20:17": "And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.",
    "20:18": "And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you all the time,",
    "21:1": "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away; and the sea is no more.",
    "21:2": "And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven of God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.",
    "21:3": "And I heard a great voice out of the throne saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God:",
    "21:4": "and he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more: the first things are passed away.",
    "21:5": "And he that sitteth on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he saith, Write: for these words are faithful and true.",
    "21:6": "And he said unto me, They are come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.",
    "21:7": "He that overcometh shall inherit these things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.",
    "21:8": "But for the fearful, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part shall be in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.",
    "21:9": "And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were laden with the seven last plagues; and he spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.",
    "21:10": "And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,",
    "21:11": "having the glory of God: her light was like unto a stone most precious, as it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal:",
    "21:12": "having a wall great and high; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:",
    "21:13": "on the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.",
    "21:14": "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.",
    "21:15": "And he that spake with me had for a measure a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.",
    "21:16": "And the city lieth foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs: the length and the breadth and the height thereof are equal.",
    "21:17": "And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.",
    "21:18": "And the building of the wall thereof was jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto pure glass.",
    "21:19": "The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;",
    "21:20": "the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.",
    "21:21": "And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the several gates was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.",
    "21:22": "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof.",
    "21:23": "And the city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine upon it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb.",
    "21:24": "And the nations shall walk amidst the light thereof: and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.",
    "21:25": "And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day (for there shall be no night there):",
    "21:26": "and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it:",
    "21:27": "and there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie: but only they that are written in the Lamb's book of life.",
    "21:28": "crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.",
    "21:29": "For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.",
    "21:30": "And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and straightway the doors were shut.",
    "21:31": "And as they were seeking to kill him, tidings came up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in confusion.",
    "21:32": "And forthwith he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down upon them: and they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.",
    "21:33": "Then the chief captain came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he was, and what he had done.",
    "21:34": "And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.",
    "22:1": "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,",
    "22:2": "in the midst of the street thereof. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.",
    "22:3": "And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him;",
    "22:4": "and they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.",
    "22:5": "And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for the Lord God shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.",
    "22:6": "And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angels to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.",
    "22:7": "And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.",
    "22:8": "And I John am he that heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.",
    "22:9": "And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship God.",
    "22:10": "And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.",
    "22:11": "He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still.",
    "22:12": "Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is.",
    "22:13": "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.",
    "22:14": "Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right to come to the tree of life, and my enter in by the gates into the city.",
    "22:15": "Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.",
    "22:16": "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright, the morning star.",
    "22:17": "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely.",
    "22:18": "I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto them, God shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book:",
    "22:19": "and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.",
    "22:20": "He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord Jesus.",
    "22:21": "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. Amen.",
    "22:22": "And they gave him audience unto this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.",
    "22:23": "And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,",
    "22:24": "the chief captain commanded him be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.",
    "23:1": "And Paul, looking stedfastly on the council, said, Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day.",
    "23:2": "And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.",
    "23:3": "Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: and sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?",
    "23:4": "And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?",
    "23:5": "And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he was high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of thy people.",
    "23:6": "But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees: touching the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.",
    "23:7": "And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.",
    "23:8": "For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.",
    "23:9": "And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an angel?",
    "23:10": "And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.",
    "23:11": "And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as thou hast testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.",
    "23:12": "And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.",
    "23:13": "And they were more than forty that made this conspiracy.",
    "23:14": "And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.",
    "23:15": "Now therefore do ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.",
    "23:16": "But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.",
    "23:17": "And Paul called unto him one of the centurions, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain; for he hath something to tell him.",
    "23:18": "So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and saith, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say to thee.",
    "23:19": "And the chief captain took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that thou hast to tell me?",
    "23:20": "And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee to bring down Paul tomorrow unto the council, as though thou wouldest inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.",
    "24:1": "And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.",
    "24:2": "And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,",
    "24:3": "we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.",
    "24:4": "But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.",
    "24:5": "For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:",
    "24:6": "who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: and we would have judged him according to our law.",
    "24:7": "But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,",
    "24:8": "commanding his accusers to come before thee. from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.",
    "24:9": "And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.",
    "24:10": "And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:",
    "24:11": "Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:",
    "24:12": "and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.",
    "24:13": "Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.",
    "24:14": "But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;",
    "24:15": "having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.",
    "24:16": "Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.",
    "24:17": "Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:",
    "24:18": "amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asia--",
    "24:19": "who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.",
    "24:20": "Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,",
    "24:21": "except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.",
    "24:22": "But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.",
    "24:23": "And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.",
    "24:24": "But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.",
    "24:25": "And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.",
    "24:26": "He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.",
    "24:27": "But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.",
    "24:28": "And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.",
    "24:29": "And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.",
    "24:30": "And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.",
    "24:31": "And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.",
    "24:32": "And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?",
    "24:33": "And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,",
    "24:34": "saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.",
    "24:35": "And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.",
    "24:36": "And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.",
    "24:37": "But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.",
    "24:38": "And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?",
    "24:39": "See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.",
    "24:40": "And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.",
    "24:41": "And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?",
    "24:42": "And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.",
    "24:43": "And he took it, and ate before them.",
    "24:44": "And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.",
    "24:45": "Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;",
    "24:46": "and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;",
    "24:47": "and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.",
    "24:48": "Ye are witnesses of these things.",
    "24:49": "And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.",
    "24:50": "And he led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.",
    "24:51": "And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.",
    "24:52": "And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:",
    "24:53": "and were continually in the temple, blessing God.",
    "24:54": "And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.",
    "24:55": "And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.",
    "24:56": "And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.",
    "24:57": "And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.",
    "24:58": "And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.",
    "24:59": "And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.",
    "24:60": "And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.",
    "24:61": "And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.",
    "24:62": "And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.",
    "24:63": "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.",
    "24:64": "And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.",
    "24:65": "And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.",
    "24:66": "And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.",
    "24:67": "And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.",
    "25:1": "Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.",
    "25:2": "And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they besought him,",
    "25:3": "asking a favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying a plot to kill him on the way.",
    "25:4": "Howbeit Festus answered, that Paul was kept in charge at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart thither shortly.",
    "25:5": "Let them therefore, saith he, that are of power among you go down with me, and if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him.",
    "25:6": "And when he had tarried among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and on the morrow he sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought.",
    "25:7": "And when he was come, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood round about him, bringing against him many and grievous charges which they could not prove;",
    "25:8": "while Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all.",
    "25:9": "But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?",
    "25:10": "But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.",
    "25:11": "If then I am a wrong-doer, and have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if none of those things is true whereof these accuse me, no man can give me up unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.",
    "25:12": "Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Caesar: unto Caesar shalt thou go.",
    "25:13": "Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and saluted Festus.",
    "25:14": "And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;",
    "25:15": "about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for sentence against him.",
    "25:16": "To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.",
    "25:17": "When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.",
    "25:18": "Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;",
    "25:19": "but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.",
    "25:20": "And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.",
    "25:21": "But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Caesar.",
    "25:22": "And Agrippa said unto Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. To-morrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.",
    "25:23": "So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.",
    "25:24": "And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.",
    "25:25": "But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.",
    "25:26": "Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.",
    "25:27": "For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.",
    "25:28": "Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.",
    "25:29": "For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.",
    "25:30": "And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",
    "25:31": "But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:",
    "25:32": "and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;",
    "25:33": "and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.",
    "25:34": "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:",
    "26:1": "And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:",
    "26:2": "I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:",
    "26:3": "especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.",
    "26:4": "My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;",
    "26:5": "having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.",
    "26:6": "And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;",
    "26:7": "unto which promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!",
    "26:8": "Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?",
    "26:9": "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",
    "26:10": "And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.",
    "26:11": "And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.",
    "26:12": "Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,",
    "26:13": "at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.",
    "26:14": "And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.",
    "26:15": "And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.",
    "26:16": "But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;",
    "26:17": "delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee,",
    "26:18": "to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.",
    "26:19": "Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:",
    "26:20": "but declared both to them of Damascus first and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judaea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.",
    "26:21": "For this cause the Jews seized me in the temple, and assayed to kill me.",
    "26:22": "Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand unto this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses did say should come;",
    "26:23": "how that the Christ must suffer, and how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.",
    "26:24": "And as he thus made his defense, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.",
    "26:25": "But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.",
    "26:26": "For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.",
    "26:27": "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.",
    "26:28": "And Agrippa said unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.",
    "26:29": "And Paul said, I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.",
    "26:30": "And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:",
    "26:31": "and when they had withdrawn, they spake one to another, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.",
    "26:32": "And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.",
    "26:33": "But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.",
    "26:34": "Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.",
    "26:35": "Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.",
    "27:1": "And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.",
    "27:2": "And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.",
    "27:3": "And the next day we touched at Sidon: and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go unto his friends and refresh himself.",
    "27:4": "And putting to sea from thence, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.",
    "27:5": "And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.",
    "27:6": "And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us therein.",
    "27:7": "And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete, over against Salmone;",
    "27:8": "and with difficulty coasting along it we came unto a certain place called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.",
    "27:9": "And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,",
    "27:10": "and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.",
    "27:11": "But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.",
    "27:12": "And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there; which is a haven of Crete, looking northeast and south-east.",
    "27:13": "And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.",
    "27:14": "But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:",
    "27:15": "and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven.",
    "27:16": "And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:",
    "27:17": "and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.",
    "27:18": "And as we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw the the freight overboard;",
    "27:19": "and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.",
    "27:20": "And when neither sun nor stars shone upon us for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.",
    "27:21": "And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.",
    "27:22": "And now I exhort you to be of good cheer; for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.",
    "27:23": "For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,",
    "27:24": "saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar: and lo, God hath granted thee all them that sail with thee.",
    "27:25": "Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even so as it hath been spoken unto me.",
    "27:26": "But we must be cast upon a certain island.",
    "27:27": "But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven to and fro in the sea of Adria, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:",
    "27:28": "and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.",
    "27:29": "And fearing lest haply we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.",
    "27:30": "And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,",
    "27:31": "Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.",
    "27:32": "Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.",
    "27:33": "And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.",
    "27:34": "Wherefore I beseech you to take some food: for this is for your safety: for there shall not a hair perish from the head of any of you.",
    "27:35": "And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat.",
    "27:36": "Then were they all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.",
    "27:37": "And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.",
    "27:38": "And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.",
    "27:39": "And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it.",
    "27:40": "And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.",
    "27:41": "But lighting upon a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and remained unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.",
    "27:42": "And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.",
    "27:43": "But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stayed them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;",
    "27:44": "and the rest, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.",
    "27:45": "Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.",
    "27:46": "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?",
    "28:1": "And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.",
    "28:2": "And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.",
    "28:3": "But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.",
    "28:4": "And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.",
    "28:5": "Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.",
    "28:6": "But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.",
    "28:7": "Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.",
    "28:8": "And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.",
    "28:9": "And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:",
    "28:10": "who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.",
    "28:11": "And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.",
    "28:12": "And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.",
    "28:13": "And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;",
    "28:14": "where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.",
    "28:15": "And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.",
    "28:16": "And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.",
    "28:17": "And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:",
    "28:18": "who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.",
    "28:19": "But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.",
    "28:20": "For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.",
    "28:21": "And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.",
    "28:22": "But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.",
    "29:1": "In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "29:2": "Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt;",
    "29:3": "speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers, that hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.",
    "29:4": "And I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales; and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, with all the fish of thy rivers which stick unto thy scales.",
    "29:5": "And I will cast thee forth into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open field; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.",
    "29:6": "And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.",
    "29:7": "When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and didst rend all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.",
    "29:8": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast.",
    "29:9": "And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. Because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it;",
    "29:10": "therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from the tower of Seveneh even unto the border of Ethiopia.",
    "29:11": "No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.",
    "29:12": "And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.",
    "29:13": "For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;",
    "29:14": "and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth; and they shall be there a base kingdom.",
    "29:15": "It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more lift itself up above the nations: and I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.",
    "29:16": "And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn to look after them: and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.",
    "29:17": "And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "29:18": "Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army, from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.",
    "29:19": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.",
    "29:20": "I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he served, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "29:21": "In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth unto the house of Israel, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.",
    "29:22": "and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;",
    "29:23": "because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I commanded them not; and I am he that knoweth, and am witness, saith Jehovah.",
    "29:24": "And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt speak, saying,",
    "29:25": "Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,",
    "29:26": "Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in shackles.",
    "29:27": "Now therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you,",
    "29:28": "forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?",
    "29:29": "And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.",
    "29:30": "Then came the word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,",
    "29:31": "Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he hath caused you to trust in a lie;",
    "29:32": "therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell among this people, neither shall he behold the good that I will do unto my people, saith Jehovah, because he hath spoken rebellion against Jehovah.",
    "29:33": "And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.",
    "29:34": "But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.",
    "29:35": "And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.",
    "30:1": "The word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,",
    "30:2": "Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Alas for the day!",
    "30:3": "For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.",
    "30:4": "And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.",
    "30:5": "Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.",
    "30:6": "Thus saith Jehovah: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "30:7": "And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.",
    "30:8": "And they shall know at I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.",
    "30:9": "In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.",
    "30:10": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.",
    "30:11": "He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.",
    "30:12": "And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, Jehovah, have spoken it.",
    "30:13": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.",
    "30:14": "And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.",
    "30:15": "And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.",
    "30:16": "And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis shall have adversaries in the day-time.",
    "30:17": "The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.",
    "30:18": "At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.",
    "30:19": "Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.",
    "30:20": "And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "30:21": "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply healing medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.",
    "30:22": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.",
    "30:23": "And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.",
    "30:24": "And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.",
    "30:25": "And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.",
    "30:26": "And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.",
    "30:27": "Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire;",
    "30:28": "and his breath is as an overflowing stream, that reacheth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction: and a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.",
    "30:29": "Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.",
    "30:30": "And Jehovah will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, and tempest, and hailstones.",
    "30:31": "For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be dismayed; with his rod will he smite him.",
    "30:32": "And every stroke of the appointed staff, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, shall be with the sound of tabrets and harps; and in battles with the brandishing of his arm will he fight with them.",
    "30:33": "For a Topheth is prepared of old; yea, for the king it is made ready; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.",
    "30:34": "And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;",
    "30:35": "and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:",
    "30:36": "and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.",
    "30:37": "And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah.",
    "30:38": "Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.",
    "30:39": "And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.",
    "30:40": "And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock.",
    "30:41": "And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;",
    "30:42": "but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.",
    "30:43": "And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.",
    "31:1": "And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "31:2": "Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness?",
    "31:3": "Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.",
    "31:4": "The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.",
    "31:5": "Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot them forth.",
    "31:6": "All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.",
    "31:7": "Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.",
    "31:8": "The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty.",
    "31:9": "I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.",
    "31:10": "Therefore thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;",
    "31:11": "I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.",
    "31:12": "And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.",
    "31:13": "Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches;",
    "31:14": "to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height, even all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.",
    "31:15": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.",
    "31:16": "I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.",
    "31:17": "They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.",
    "31:18": "To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "31:19": "Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.",
    "31:20": "Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.",
    "31:21": "Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.",
    "31:22": "How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for Jehovah hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.",
    "31:23": "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: Jehovah bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.",
    "31:24": "And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.",
    "31:25": "For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.",
    "31:26": "Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.",
    "31:27": "Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.",
    "31:28": "And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith Jehovah.",
    "31:29": "In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.",
    "31:30": "But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.",
    "31:31": "Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:",
    "31:32": "not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.",

    "31:34": "and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.",
    "31:35": "Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; Jehovah of hosts is his name:",
    "31:36": "If these ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.",
    "31:37": "Thus saith Jehovah: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith Jehovah.",

    "31:40": "And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.",
    "31:41": "And Moses gave the tribute, which was Jehovah's heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.",

    "33:3": "if, when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;",
    "33:4": "then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.",
    "33:5": "He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning, he would have delivered his soul.",
    "33:6": "But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned, and the sword come, and take any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.",
    "33:7": "So thou, son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.",
    "33:8": "When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand.",
    "33:9": "Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.",
    "33:10": "And thou, son of man, say unto the house of Israel: Thus ye speak, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them; how then can we live?",
    "33:11": "Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?",
    "33:12": "And thou, son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall he that is righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth.",
    "33:13": "When I say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.",
    "33:14": "Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;",
    "33:15": "if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.",
    "33:16": "None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered against him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.",
    "33:17": "Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.",
    "33:18": "When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die therein.",
    "33:19": "And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.",
    "33:20": "Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.",
    "34:1": "And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "34:2": "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the sheep?",
    "34:3": "Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill the fatlings; but ye feed not the sheep.",
    "34:4": "The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought back that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with rigor have ye ruled over them.",
    "34:5": "And they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.",
    "34:6": "My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and there was none that did search or seek after them.",
    "34:7": "Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:",
    "34:8": "As I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, surely forasmuch as my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became food to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my sheep;",
    "34:9": "therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of Jehovah:",
    "34:10": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may not be food for them.",
    "34:11": "For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I myself, even I, will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.",
    "34:12": "As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.",
    "34:13": "And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the inhabited places of the country.",
    "34:14": "I will feed them with good pasture; and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.",
    "34:15": "I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "34:16": "I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them in justice.",
    "34:17": "And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, the rams and the he-goats.",
    "34:18": "Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?",
    "34:19": "And as for my sheep, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.",
    "34:20": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.",
    "34:21": "Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;",
    "34:22": "therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.",
    "34:23": "And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.",
    "34:24": "And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and my servant David prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken it.",
    "34:25": "And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.",
    "34:26": "And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall be showers of blessing.",
    "34:27": "And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand of those that made bondmen of them.",
    "34:28": "And they shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid.",
    "34:29": "And I will raise up unto them a plantation for renown, and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear the shame of the nations any more.",
    "34:30": "And they shall know that I, Jehovah, their God am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "34:31": "And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "35:1": "Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "35:2": "Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,",
    "35:3": "and say unto it, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, O mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment.",
    "35:4": "I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.",
    "35:5": "Because thou hast had a perpetual enmity, and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;",
    "35:6": "therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hast not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.",
    "35:7": "Thus will I make mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation; and I will cut off from it him that passeth through and him that returneth.",
    "35:8": "And I will fill its mountains with its slain: in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy watercourses shall they fall that are slain with the sword.",
    "35:9": "I will make thee a perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",
    "35:10": "Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Jehovah was there:",
    "35:11": "therefore, as I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast showed out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I shall judge thee.",
    "35:12": "And thou shalt know that I, Jehovah, have heard all thy revilings which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.",
    "35:13": "And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard it.",
    "35:14": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.",
    "35:15": "As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.",
    "35:16": "Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;",
    "35:17": "therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.",
    "35:18": "And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he commanded you;",
    "35:19": "therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.",
    "35:20": "For they speak not peace; But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.",
    "35:21": "Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.",
    "35:22": "Thou hast seen it, O Jehovah; keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.",
    "35:23": "Stir up thyself, and awake to the justice due unto me, Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.",
    "35:24": "Judge me, O Jehovah my God, according to thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.",

    "36:1": "And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah.",
    "36:2": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;",
    "36:3": "therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because, even because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;",
    "36:4": "therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;",

    "36:6": "Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the shame of the nations:",
    "36:7": "therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have sworn, saying, Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame.",
    "36:8": "But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.",

    "36:15": "neither will I let thee hear any more the shame of the nations, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to stumble any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "36:16": "Moreover the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,",
    "36:17": "Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.",
    "36:18": "Wherefore I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had poured out upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;",

    "36:34": "And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.",
    "36:35": "And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.",
    "36:36": "Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, Jehovah, have builded the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.",
    "36:37": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.",

    "36:42": "chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,",
    "36:43": "chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.",
    "37:1": "The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Jehovah, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.",
    "37:2": "And he caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.",
    "37:3": "And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.",
    "37:4": "Again he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.",
    "37:5": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.",
    "37:6": "And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.",
    "37:7": "So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.",
    "37:8": "And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.",
    "37:9": "Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.",
    "37:10": "So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.",
    "37:11": "Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.",
    "37:12": "Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.",
    "37:13": "And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O my people.",

    "37:20": "And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.",
    "37:21": "And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:",
    "37:22": "and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;",
    "37:23": "neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.",

    "37:29": "Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogancy is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.",
    "37:30": "And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.",
    "37:31": "And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.",
    "37:32": "For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.",
    "37:33": "Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.",
    "37:34": "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith Jehovah.",

    "38:12": "to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.",
    "38:13": "Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take the spoil? hast thou assembled thy company to take the prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take great spoil?",
    "38:14": "Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In that day when my people Israel dwelleth securely, shalt thou not know it?",
    "38:15": "And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost parts of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army;",
    "38:16": "and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.",
    "38:17": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, that prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring thee against them?",
    "38:18": "And it shall come to pass in that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.",
    "38:19": "For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;",
    "38:20": "so that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.",

    "39:9": "And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall make fires of them seven years;",
    "39:10": "so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of the weapons; and they shall plunder those that plundered them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "39:11": "And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of them that pass through on the east of the sea; and it shall stop them that pass through: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.",
    "39:12": "And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them, that they may cleanse the land.",
    "39:13": "Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "39:14": "And they shall set apart men of continual employment, that shall pass through the land, and, with them that pass through, those that bury them that remain upon the face of the land, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.",
    "39:15": "And they that pass through the land shall pass through; and when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog.",
    "39:16": "And Hamonah shall also be the name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse the land.",
    "39:17": "And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink blood.",
    "39:18": "Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.",

    "39:21": "And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.",
    "39:22": "So the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God, from that day and forward.",
    "39:23": "And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me, and I hid my face from them: so I gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.",
    "40:1": "In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.",
    "40:2": "In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.",
    "40:3": "And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.",
    "40:4": "And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.",
    "40:5": "And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.",
    "40:6": "Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.",
    "40:7": "And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.",
    "40:8": "He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.",
    "40:9": "Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.",
    "40:10": "And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.",
    "40:11": "And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;",
    "40:12": "and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.",
    "40:13": "And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.",
    "40:14": "He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court reached unto the posts, round about the gate.",
    "40:15": "And from the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.",
    "40:16": "And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon each post were palm-trees.",
    "40:17": "Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.",
    "40:18": "And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.",
    "40:19": "Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, both on the east and on the north.",
    "40:20": "And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.",
    "40:21": "And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.",
    "40:22": "And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.",
    "40:23": "And there was a gate to the inner court over against the other gate, both on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.",
    "41:1": "And he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.",
    "41:2": "And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.",
    "41:3": "Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, seven cubits.",
    "41:4": "And he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.",
    "41:5": "Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.",
    "41:6": "And the side-chambers were in three stories, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which belonged to the house for the side-chambers round about, that they might have hold therein, and not have hold in the wall of the house.",
    "41:7": "And the side-chambers were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.",
    "41:8": "I saw also that the house had a raised basement round about: the foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.",
    "41:9": "The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chambers, on the outside, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that belonged to the house.",
    "41:10": "And between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.",
    "41:11": "And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.",
    "41:12": "And the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.",
    "41:13": "So he measured the house, a hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, a hundred cubits long;",
    "41:14": "also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.",
    "41:15": "And he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at the back thereof, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;",
    "41:16": "the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the threshold, ceiled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, (now the windows were covered),",
    "41:17": "to the space above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.",
    "41:18": "And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees; and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;",
    "41:19": "so that there was the face of a man toward the palm-tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. thus was it made through all the house round about:",
    "41:20": "from the ground unto above the door were cherubim and palm-trees made: thus was the wall of the temple.",
    "41:21": "As for the temple, the door-posts were squared; and as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple.",
    "41:22": "The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.",
    "41:23": "And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.",
    "41:24": "And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves: two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other.",
    "41:25": "And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there was a threshold of wood upon the face of the porch without.",
    "41:26": "And there were closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch: thus were the side-chambers of the house, and the thresholds.",
    "41:27": "I am the first that saith unto Zion, Behold, behold them; and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.",
    "41:28": "And when I look, there is no man: even among them there is no counsellor, that, when I ask of them, can answer a word.",
    "41:29": "Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nought; their molten images are wind and confusion.",
    "41:30": "His underparts are like sharp potsherds: He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.",
    "41:31": "He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.",
    "41:32": "He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.",
    "41:33": "Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.",
    "41:34": "He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.",
    "41:35": "And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.",
    "41:36": "And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.",
    "41:37": "And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.",
    "41:38": "And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?",
    "41:39": "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:",
    "41:40": "thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.",
    "41:41": "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.",
    "41:42": "And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;",
    "41:43": "and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.",
    "41:44": "And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.",
    "41:45": "And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.",
    "41:46": "And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.",
    "41:47": "And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.",
    "41:48": "And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.",
    "41:49": "And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.",
    "41:50": "And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.",
    "41:51": "And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.",
    "41:52": "And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.",
    "41:53": "And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.",
    "41:54": "And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.",
    "41:55": "And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.",
    "41:56": "And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.",
    "41:57": "And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.",
    "42:1": "Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was over against the building toward the north.",
    "42:2": "Before the length of a hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.",
    "42:3": "Over against the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the third story.",
    "42:4": "And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.",
    "42:5": "Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from these, more than from the lower and the middlemost, in the building.",
    "42:6": "For they were in three stories, and they had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the uppermost was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.",
    "42:7": "And the wall that was without by the side of the chambers, toward the outer court before the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.",
    "42:8": "For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were a hundred cubits.",
    "42:9": "And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the outer court.",
    "42:10": "In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, before the separate place, and before the building, there were chambers.",
    "42:11": "And the way before them was like the appearance of the way of the chambers which were toward the north; according to their length so was their breadth: and all their egresses were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.",
    "42:12": "And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.",
    "42:13": "Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers, where the priests that are near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; for the place is holy.",
    "42:14": "When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach to that which pertaineth to the people.",
    "42:15": "Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.",
    "42:16": "He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.",
    "42:17": "He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.",
    "42:18": "He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.",
    "42:19": "He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.",
    "42:20": "He measured it on the four sides: it had a wall round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common.",
    "42:21": "and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you.",
    "42:22": "Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there.",
    "42:23": "Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come?",
    "42:24": "Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not Jehovah? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law.",
    "42:25": "Therefore he poured upon him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.",
    "42:26": "And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.",
    "42:27": "And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.",
    "42:28": "And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?",
    "42:29": "And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,",
    "42:30": "The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.",
    "42:31": "And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:",
    "42:32": "we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.",
    "42:33": "And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way;",
    "42:34": "and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.",
    "42:35": "And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.",
    "42:36": "And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.",
    "42:37": "And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.",
    "42:38": "And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.",
    "43:1": "Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east.",
    "43:2": "And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory.",
    "43:3": "And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.",
    "43:4": "And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.",
    "43:5": "And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.",
    "43:6": "And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house; and a man stood by me.",
    "43:7": "And he said unto me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, and by the dead bodies of their kings in their high places;",
    "43:8": "in their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post beside my door-post, and there was but the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.",
    "43:9": "Now let them put away their whoredom, and the dead bodies of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.",
    "43:10": "Thou, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.",
    "43:11": "And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known unto them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the egresses thereof, and the entrances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight; that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.",
    "43:12": "This is the law of the house: upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.",
    "43:13": "And these are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth): the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.",
    "43:14": "And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.",
    "43:15": "And the upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth and upward there shall be four horns.",
    "43:16": "And the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, square in the four sides thereof.",
    "43:17": "And the ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit round about; and the steps thereof shall look toward the east.",
    "43:18": "And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt-offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.",
    "43:19": "Thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok, who are near unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord Jehovah, a young bullock for a sin-offering.",
    "43:20": "And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse it and make atonement for it.",
    "43:21": "Thou shalt also take the bullock of the sin-offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.",
    "43:22": "And on the second day thou shalt offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.",
    "43:23": "When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.",
    "43:24": "And thou shalt bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.",
    "43:25": "Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin-offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.",
    "43:26": "Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.",
    "43:27": "And when they have accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "43:28": "Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.",
    "43:29": "And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.",
    "43:30": "And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.",
    "43:31": "And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.",
    "43:32": "And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.",
    "43:33": "And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.",
    "43:34": "And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.",
    "44:1": "Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.",
    "44:2": "And Jehovah said unto me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.",
    "44:3": "As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.",
    "44:4": "Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house; and I looked, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I fell upon my face.",
    "44:5": "And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entrance of the house, with every egress of the sanctuary.",
    "44:6": "And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,",
    "44:7": "in that ye have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add unto all your abominations.",
    "44:8": "And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.",
    "44:9": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any foreigners that are among the children of Israel.",
    "44:10": "But the Levites that went far from me, when Israel went astray, that went astray from me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.",
    "44:11": "Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house: they shall slay the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.",
    "44:12": "Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and became a stumblingblock of iniquity unto the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord Jehovah, and they shall bear their iniquity.",
    "44:13": "And they shall not come near unto me, to execute the office of priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, unto the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.",
    "44:14": "Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.",
    "44:15": "But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me; and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord Jehovah:",
    "44:16": "they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.",
    "44:17": "And it shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.",
    "44:18": "They shall have linen tires upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causeth sweat.",
    "44:19": "And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, that they sanctify not the people with their garments.",
    "44:20": "Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.",
    "44:21": "Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.",
    "44:22": "Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that is the widow of a priest.",
    "44:23": "And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.",
    "44:24": "And in a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to mine ordinances shall they judge it: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.",
    "44:25": "And they shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.",
    "44:26": "And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.",
    "44:27": "And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "44:28": "And they shall have an inheritance: I am their inheritance; and ye shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.",
    "44:29": "They shall eat the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.",
    "44:30": "And the first of all the first-fruits of every thing, and every oblation of everything, of all your oblations, shall be for the priest: ye shall also give unto the priests the first of your dough, to cause a blessing to rest on thy house.",
    "44:31": "The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast.",
    "44:32": "For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.",
    "44:33": "Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.",
    "44:34": "For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.",
    "45:1": "Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand: it shall be holy in all the border thereof round about.",
    "45:2": "Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred in length by five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about.",
    "45:3": "And of this measure shalt thou measure a length of five and twenty thousand, and a breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary, which is most holy.",
    "45:4": "It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, that come near to minister unto Jehovah; and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place for the sanctuary.",
    "45:5": "And five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth, shall be unto the Levites, the ministers of the house, for a possession unto themselves, for twenty chambers.",
    "45:6": "And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, side by side with the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.",
    "45:7": "And whatsoever is for the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city, in front of the holy oblation and in front of the possession of the city, on the west side westward, and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable unto one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.",
    "45:8": "In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.",
    "45:9": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness; take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "45:10": "Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.",
    "45:11": "The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.",
    "45:12": "And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.",
    "45:13": "This is the oblation that ye shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah from a homer of barley;",
    "45:14": "and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, even a homer; (for ten baths are a homer;)",
    "45:15": "and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel; -for a meal-offering, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for them, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "45:16": "All the people of the land shall give unto this oblation for the prince in Israel.",
    "45:17": "And it shall be the prince's part to give the burnt-offerings, and the meal-offerings, and the drink-offerings, in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the sabbaths, in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin-offering, and the meal-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.",
    "45:18": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish; and thou shalt cleanse the sanctuary.",
    "45:19": "And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering, and put it upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.",
    "45:20": "And so thou shalt do on the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye make atonement for the house.",
    "45:21": "In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.",
    "45:22": "And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering.",
    "45:23": "And the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering.",
    "45:24": "And he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.",
    "45:25": "In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days; according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, and according to the meal-offering, and according to the oil.",
    "45:26": "And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.",
    "45:27": "And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:",
    "45:28": "and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.",
    "46:1": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.",
    "46:2": "And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.",
    "46:3": "And the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons.",
    "46:4": "And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto Jehovah shall be on the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;",
    "46:5": "and the meal-offering shall be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.",
    "46:6": "And on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:",
    "46:7": "and he shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.",
    "46:8": "And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.",
    "46:9": "But when the people of the land shall come before Jehovah in the appointed feasts, he that entereth by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth straight before him.",
    "46:10": "And the prince, when they go in, shall go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they shall go forth together.",
    "46:11": "And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering shall be an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.",
    "46:12": "And when the prince shall prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate that looketh toward the east; and he shall prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he doth on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.",
    "46:13": "And thou shalt prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah daily: morning by morning shalt thou prepare it.",
    "46:14": "And thou shalt prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance.",
    "46:15": "Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.",
    "46:16": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.",
    "46:17": "But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall be for his sons.",
    "46:18": "Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.",
    "46:19": "Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the hinder part westward.",
    "46:20": "And he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, and where they shall bake the meal-offering; that they bring them not forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.",
    "46:21": "Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.",
    "46:22": "In the four corners of the court there were courts inclosed, forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four in the corners were of one measure.",
    "46:23": "And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.",
    "46:24": "Then said he unto me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.",
    "46:25": "Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saith: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and them that trust in him:",
    "46:26": "and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith Jehovah.",
    "46:27": "But fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.",
    "46:28": "Fear not thou, O Jacob my servant, saith Jehovah; for I am with thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee; but I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.",
    "46:29": "And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.",
    "46:30": "And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.",
    "46:31": "And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;",
    "46:32": "and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.",
    "46:33": "And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?",
    "46:34": "that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.",
    "47:1": "And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward; (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;) and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar.",
    "47:2": "Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round by the way without unto the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.",
    "47:3": "When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.",
    "47:4": "Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the loins.",
    "47:5": "Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.",
    "47:6": "And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.",
    "47:7": "Now when I had returned, behold, upon the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.",
    "47:8": "Then said he unto me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah; and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea shall the waters go which were made to issue forth; and the waters shall be healed.",
    "47:9": "And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters are come thither, and the waters of the sea shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh.",
    "47:10": "And it shall come to pass, that fishers shall stand by it: from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.",
    "47:11": "But the miry places thereof, and the marshes thereof, shall not be healed; they shall be given up to salt.",
    "47:12": "And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not whither, neither shall the fruit thereof fail: it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for healing.",
    "47:13": "Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.",
    "47:14": "And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I sware to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.",

    "47:17": "And the border from the sea, shall be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.",
    "47:18": "And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan; from the north border unto the east sea shall ye measure. This is the east side.",
    "47:19": "And the south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook of Egypt, unto the great sea. This is the south side southward.",
    "47:20": "And the west side shall be the great sea, from the south border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.",
    "47:21": "So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.",
    "47:22": "And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who shall beget children among you; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.",
    "47:23": "And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "47:24": "And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.",
    "47:25": "And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.",
    "47:26": "And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.",
    "47:27": "And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.",
    "47:28": "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.",
    "47:29": "And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;",
    "47:30": "but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.",
    "47:31": "And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.",
    "48:1": "Now these are the names of the tribes: From the north end, beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they shall have their sides east and west,) Dan, one portion.",

    "48:11": "It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, that have kept my charge, that went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.",
    "48:12": "And it shall be unto them an oblation from the oblation of the land, a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.",
    "48:13": "And answerable unto the border of the priests, the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.",
    "48:14": "And they shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first-fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy unto Jehovah.",
    "48:15": "And the five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front of the five and twenty thousand, shall be for common use, for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city shall be in the midst thereof.",
    "48:16": "And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.",

    "48:18": "And the residue in the length, answerable unto the holy oblation, shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward; and it shall be answerable unto the holy oblation; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto them that labor in the city.",
    "48:19": "And they that labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it.",
    "48:20": "All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation four-square, with the possession of the city.",
    "48:21": "And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation and of the possession of the city; in front of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, answerable unto the portions, it shall be for the prince: and the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.",
    "48:22": "Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, it shall be for the prince.",
    "49:1": "Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities thereof?",
    "49:2": "Therefore, behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess them that did possess him, saith Jehovah.",
    "49:3": "Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.",
    "49:4": "Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?",
    "49:5": "Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.",
    "49:6": "But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.",
    "49:7": "Of Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?",

    "49:9": "If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?",
    "49:10": "But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brethren, and his neighbors; and he is not.",
    "49:11": "Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.",
    "49:12": "For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.",
    "49:13": "For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.",
    "49:14": "I have heard tidings from Jehovah, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.",

    "49:16": "As for thy terribleness, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith Jehovah.",
    "49:17": "And Edom shall become an astonishment: every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.",
    "49:18": "As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith Jehovah, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.",
    "49:19": "Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me?",
    "49:20": "Therefore hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.",
    "49:21": "The earth trembleth at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.",
    "49:22": "Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.",

    "9:31": "but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.",
    "9:32": "Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;",

    "12:48": "He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.",
    "12:49": "For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.",
    "12:50": "And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.",

    "14:27": "If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret:",
    "14:28": "but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.",
    "14:29": "And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.",
    "14:30": "But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.",

    "40:29": "and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.",
    "40:30": "And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.",
    "40:31": "And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.",
    "40:32": "And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;",
    "40:33": "and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.",
    "40:34": "And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.",
    "40:35": "And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured it according to these measures;",
    "40:36": "the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.",
    "40:37": "And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.",
    "40:38": "And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.",
    "4:32": "and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.",
    "4:33": "And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.",
    "4:34": "For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,",
    "4:35": "and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.",
    "7:26": "For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;",
    "7:27": "who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.",
    "7:28": "For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.",
    "7:29": "But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;",
    "7:30": "and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;",
    "7:31": "and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.",
    "7:32": "But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:",
    "7:33": "but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,",
    "7:34": "and is divided. So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
    "7:35": "And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.",
    "7:36": "But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.",
    "7:37": "But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, shall do well.",
    "7:38": "So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.",
    "8:33": "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth;",
    "8:34": "who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.",
    "8:35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",
    "8:36": "Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.",
    "11:33": "who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,",
    "11:34": "quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, waxed mighty in war, turned to flight armies of aliens.",
    "11:35": "Women received their dead by a resurrection: and others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:",
    "11:36": "and others had trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:",
    "11:37": "they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword: they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated",
    "11:38": "(of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth.",
    "11:39": "And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,",
    "11:40": "God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.",
    "11:41": "So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.",
    "11:42": "And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.",
    "11:43": "And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.",
    "11:44": "He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.",
    "11:45": "Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.",
    "11:46": "But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.",
    "11:47": "The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.",
    "13:23": "Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.",
    "13:24": "Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.",
    "13:25": "Grace be with you all. Amen.",
    "13:26": "Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.",
    "13:27": "For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.",
    "13:28": "And though they found no cause of death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.",
    "13:29": "And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.",
    "13:30": "But God raised him from the dead:",
    "13:31": "and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.",
    "13:32": "And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers,",
    "13:33": "that God hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.",
    "13:34": "And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.",
    "13:35": "Because he saith also in another psalm, Thou wilt not give Thy Holy One to see corruption.",
    "13:36": "For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:",
    "13:37": "but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.",
    "13:38": "Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins:",
    "13:39": "and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.",
    "13:40": "Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:",
    "13:41": "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your days, A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.",
    "13:42": "And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.",
    "13:43": "Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.",
    "13:44": "And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.",
    "13:45": "But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.",
    "13:46": "And Paul and Barnabas spake out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.",
    "13:47": "For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.",
    "13:48": "And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.",
    "13:49": "And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.",
    "13:50": "But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.",
    "13:51": "But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.",
    "13:52": "And the disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.",
    "13:53": "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.",
    "13:54": "And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?",
    "13:55": "Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?",
    "13:56": "And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?",
    "13:57": "And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.",
    "13:58": "And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.",
    "13:59": "This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.",
    "14:32": "and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;",
    "14:33": "for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,",
    "14:34": "let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.",
    "14:35": "And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.",
    "14:36": "What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?",
    "14:37": "If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.",
    "14:38": "But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.",
    "14:39": "Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.",
    "14:40": "But let all things be done decently and in order.",
    "14:41": "And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
    "14:42": "Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.",
    "14:43": "And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.",
    "14:44": "Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.",
    "14:45": "And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him.",
    "14:46": "And they laid hands on him, and took him.",
    "14:47": "But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.",
    "14:48": "And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?",
    "14:49": "I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled.",
    "14:50": "And they all left him, and fled.",
    "14:51": "And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him;",
    "14:52": "but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.",
    "14:53": "And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.",
    "14:54": "And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.",
    "14:55": "Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found it not.",
    "14:56": "For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together.",
    "14:57": "And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,",
    "15:28": "And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.",
    "15:29": "Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?",
    "15:30": "Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?",
    "15:31": "I protest by that glorifying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.",
    "15:32": "If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.",
    "15:33": "Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.",
    "20:27": "For I shrank not from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God.",
    "22:32": "but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.",
    "22:33": "And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.",
    "23:34": "And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,",
    "23:35": "I will hear thee fully, said he, when thine accusers also are come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.",
    "23:36": "And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,",
    "23:37": "and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.",
    "23:38": "And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "23:39": "And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.",
    "23:40": "But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?",
    "23:41": "And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.",
    "23:42": "And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.",
    "23:43": "And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.",
    "23:44": "And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,",
    "25:41": "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:",
    "25:42": "for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;",
    "25:43": "I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.",
    "25:44": "Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?",
    "25:45": "Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.",
    "25:46": "And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.",
    "25:47": "And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family;",
    "25:48": "after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;",
    "25:49": "or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.",
    "25:50": "And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.",
    "25:51": "If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.",
    "25:52": "And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.",
    "25:53": "As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.",
    "25:54": "And if he be not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.",
    "25:55": "For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.",
    "26:38": "Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.",
    "26:39": "And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.",
    "26:40": "And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?",
    "26:41": "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.",
    "26:42": "Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.",
    "26:43": "And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.",
    "26:44": "And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.",
    "26:45": "Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
    "26:46": "Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.",
    "1:32": "who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.",
    "1:33": "And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.",
    "1:34": "And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.",
    "1:35": "Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;",
    "1:36": "and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!",
    "1:37": "And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.",
    "1:38": "And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?",
    "1:39": "He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.",
    "1:40": "One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.",
    "1:41": "He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).",
    "1:42": "He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).",
    "1:43": "On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.",
    "1:44": "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.",
    "1:45": "Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.",
    "1:46": "And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.",
    "1:47": "Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!",
    "1:48": "Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.",
    "1:49": "Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.",
    "1:50": "Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.",
    "1:51": "And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.",
    "1:52": "He hath put down princes from their thrones, And hath exalted them of low degree.",
    "1:53": "The hungry he hath filled with good things; And the rich he hath sent empty away.",
    "1:54": "He hath given help to Israel his servant, That he might remember mercy",
    "2:26": "And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations:",
    "2:27": "and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father:",
    "2:28": "and I will give him the morning star.",
    "2:29": "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.",
    "2:30": "because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.",
    "2:31": "he foreseeing this spake of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left unto Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.",
    "2:32": "This Jesus did God raise up, whereof we all are witnesses.",
    "2:33": "Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath poured forth this, which ye see and hear.",
    "2:34": "For David ascended not into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,",
    "3:25": "For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.",
    "3:26": "For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.",
    "3:27": "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.",
    "3:28": "There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus.",
    "3:29": "And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.",
    "3:30": "if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.",
    "3:31": "Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.",
    "3:32": "What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.",
    "3:33": "He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this, that God is true.",

    "28:61": "Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.",
    "28:62": "And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God.",
    "28:63": "And it shall come to pass, that, as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest in to possess it.",
    "28:64": "And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, even wood and stone.",
    "28:65": "And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of thy foot: but Jehovah will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;",
    "28:66": "and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear night and day, and shalt have no assurance of thy life.",
    "28:67": "In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.",
    "28:68": "And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.",
    "32:43": "And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.",
    "32:44": "Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith Jehovah.",
    "32:45": "And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;",
    "32:46": "And he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.",
    "32:47": "For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.",
    "32:48": "And Jehovah spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,",
    "32:49": "Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;",
    "32:50": "and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:",
    "32:51": "because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.",
    "32:52": "For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.",
    "10:37": "For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.",
    "10:38": "But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.",
    "10:39": "But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.",
    "10:40": "Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,",
    "10:41": "not to all the people, but unto witnesses that were chosen before of God, even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.",
    "10:42": "And he charged us to preach unto the people, and to testify that this is he who is ordained of God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.",
    "10:43": "To him bear all the prophets witness, that through his name every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.",
    "15:42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:",
    "15:43": "it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:",
    "15:44": "it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.",
    "15:45": "So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.",
    "15:46": "Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.",
    "15:47": "The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.",
    "15:48": "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.",
    "15:49": "And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.",
    "15:50": "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.",
    "15:51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,",
    "15:52": "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.",
    "15:53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.",
    "15:54": "But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.",
    "15:55": "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?",
    "15:56": "The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:",
    "15:57": "but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "15:58": "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.",
    "15:59": "and Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.",
    "15:60": "Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.",
    "15:61": "In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,",
    "15:62": "and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.",
    "15:63": "And as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.",
    "19:39": "But if ye seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.",
    "19:40": "For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause for it: and as touching it we shall not be able to give account of this concourse.",
    "19:41": "And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.",
    "19:42": "There then because of the Jews' Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.",
    "19:43": "For the days shall come upon thee, when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,",
    "19:44": "and shall dash thee to the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.",
    "19:45": "And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold,",
    "19:46": "saying unto them, It is written, And my house shall be a house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of robbers.",
    "19:47": "And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:",
    "19:48": "and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung upon him, listening.",
    "19:49": "So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:",
    "19:50": "according to the commandment of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.",
    "19:51": "These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.",
    "21:37": "And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he saith unto the chief captain, May I say something unto thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek?",
    "21:38": "Art thou not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?",
    "21:39": "But Paul said, I am a Jew, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I beseech thee, give me leave to speak unto the people.",
    "21:40": "And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand unto the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew language, saying,",
    "21:41": "They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.",
    "21:42": "Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from the Lord, And it is marvelous in our eyes?",
    "21:43": "Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.",
    "21:44": "And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.",
    "21:45": "And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.",
    "6:31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.",
    "6:32": "Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.",
    "6:33": "For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.",
    "6:34": "They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.",
    "6:35": "Jesus said unto them. I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.",
    "6:36": "But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.",
    "6:37": "All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.",
    "6:38": "For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.",
    "6:39": "And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.",
    "6:40": "For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "9:36": "Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.",
    "9:37": "And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.",
    "9:38": "And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us.",
    "9:39": "And Peter arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.",
    "9:40": "But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.",
    "9:41": "And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.",
    "9:42": "And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.",
    "9:43": "And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.",
    "9:44": "Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.",
    "9:45": "But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.",
    "9:46": "And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.",
    "9:47": "But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,",
    "9:48": "and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.",
    "9:49": "And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.",
    "9:50": "But Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.",
    "9:51": "And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,",
    "9:52": "and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.",
    "9:53": "And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem.",
    "9:54": "And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?",
    "9:55": "But he turned, and rebuked them.",
    "9:56": "And they went to another village.",
    "9:57": "And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.",
    "20:30": "and from among your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.",
    "20:31": "Wherefore watch ye, remembering that by the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.",
    "20:32": "And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you the inheritance among all them that are sanctified.",
    "20:33": "I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.",
    "20:34": "Ye yourselves know that these hands ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.",
    "20:35": "In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring ye ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.",
    "20:36": "And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.",
    "20:37": "And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,",
    "20:38": "sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should behold his face no more. And they brought him on his way unto the ship.",
    "20:39": "And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.",
    "20:40": "For they durst not any more ask him any question.",
    "20:41": "And he said unto them, How say they that the Christ is David's son?",
    "20:42": "For David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,",
    "20:43": "Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.",
    "20:44": "David therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?",
    "20:45": "And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples,",
    "20:46": "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts;",
    "20:47": "who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.",
    "20:48": "And all flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.",
    "17:28": "for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.",
    "17:29": "Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.",
    "17:30": "The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent:",
    "17:31": "inasmuch as he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.",
    "17:32": "Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear thee concerning this yet again.",
    "17:33": "Thus Paul went out from among them.",
    "17:34": "But certain men clave unto him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.",
    "17:35": "There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.",
    "17:36": "There shall be two men in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.",
    "17:37": "And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body is, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.",
    "17:38": "and the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods:",
    "17:39": "but Jehovah your God shall ye fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.",
    "17:40": "Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.",
    "17:41": "So these nations feared Jehovah, and served their graven images; their children likewise, and their children's children, as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.",
    "17:42": "And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair countenance.",
    "17:43": "And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.",
    "17:44": "And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the field.",
    "17:45": "Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.",
    "17:46": "This day will Jehovah deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from off thee; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day unto the birds of the heavens, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,",
    "17:47": "and that all this assembly may know that Jehovah saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is Jehovah's, and he will give you into our hand.",
    "17:48": "And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.",
    "17:49": "And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.",
    "17:50": "So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.",
    "17:51": "Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.",
    "17:52": "And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou comest to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.",
    "17:53": "And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.",
    "17:54": "And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.",
    "17:55": "And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.",
    "17:56": "And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.",
    "17:57": "And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.",
    "17:58": "And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.",
    "22:42": "saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.",
    "22:43": "And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.",
    "22:44": "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.",
    "22:45": "And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,",
    "22:46": "and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.",
    "22:47": "While he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.",
    "22:48": "But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?",
    "22:49": "And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?",
    "22:50": "And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.",
    "22:51": "But Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.",
    "2:38": "And Peter said unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
    "2:39": "For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him.",
    "2:40": "And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.",
    "2:41": "They then that received his word were baptized: and there were added unto them in that day about three thousand souls.",
    "2:42": "And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.",
    "2:43": "And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.",
    "2:44": "And all that believed were together, and had all things common;",
    "2:45": "and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according as any man had need.",
    "2:46": "And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,",
    "8:37": "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.",
    "8:38": "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,",
    "8:39": "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "8:40": "But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.",
    "8:41": "Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.",
    "8:42": "Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.",
    "8:43": "Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.",
    "8:44": "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.",
    "8:45": "But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.",
    "8:46": "Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?",
    "8:47": "He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of God.",
    "8:48": "The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?",
    "8:49": "Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.",
    "8:50": "But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.",
    "8:51": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.",
    "8:52": "The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.",
    "8:53": "Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?",
    "8:54": "Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;",
    "8:55": "and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.",
    "8:56": "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.",
    "8:57": "The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?",
    "8:58": "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.",
    "8:59": "They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.",
    "8:60": "that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah, he is God; there is none else.",
    "8:61": "Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.",

    "57:11": "And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not?",
    "58:1": "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.",
    "58:2": "Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto God.",
    "58:3": "Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure, and exact all your labors.",
    "58:4": "Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.",
    "58:5": "Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Jehovah?",
    "58:6": "Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?",
    "58:7": "Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?",
    "58:8": "Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall by thy rearward.",
    "58:9": "Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;",
    "58:10": "and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday;",
    "58:11": "and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.",
    "59:1": "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:",
    "59:2": "but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear.",
    "59:3": "For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.",
    "59:4": "None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.",
    "59:5": "They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.",
    "59:6": "Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.",
    "59:7": "Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.",
    "59:8": "The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.",
    "59:9": "Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.",
    "59:10": "We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men.",
    "59:11": "We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.",
    "59:12": "For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:",
    "59:13": "transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.",
    "59:14": "And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.",
    "59:15": "Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.",
    "59:16": "And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.",
    "59:17": "And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.",
    "60:1": "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.",
    "60:2": "For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.",
    "60:3": "And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.",
    "60:4": "Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be carried in the arms.",
    "60:5": "Then thou shalt see and be radiant, and thy heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.",
    "60:6": "The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.",
    "60:7": "All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee; they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar; and I will glorify the house of my glory.",
    "60:8": "Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?",
    "60:9": "Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.",
    "60:10": "And foreigners shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.",
    "60:11": "Thy gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.",
    "60:12": "For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.",
    "61:1": "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;",
    "61:2": "to proclaim the year of Jehovah's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;",
    "61:3": "to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.",
    "61:4": "And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.",
    "61:5": "And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.",
    "61:6": "But ye shall be named the priests of Jehovah; men shall call you the ministers of our God: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.",
    "61:7": "Instead of your shame ye shall have double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.",
    "61:8": "For I, Jehovah, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.",
    "62:1": "For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth.",
    "62:2": "And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.",
    "62:3": "Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.",
    "62:4": "Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.",
    "62:5": "For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.",
    "62:6": "I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are Jehovah's remembrancers, take ye no rest,",
    "62:7": "and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.",
    "62:8": "Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored:",
    "62:9": "but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.",
    "62:10": "Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples.",
    "62:11": "Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.",
    "62:12": "And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Jehovah: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.",
    "63:1": "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.",
    "63:2": "Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat?",
    "63:3": "I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.",
    "63:4": "For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.",
    "63:5": "And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my wrath, it upheld me.",
    "63:6": "And I trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.",
    "63:7": "I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, and the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.",
    "63:8": "For he said, Surely, they are my people, children that will not deal falsely: so he was their Saviour.",
    "63:9": "In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.",
    "63:10": "But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.",
    "63:11": "Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit in the midst of them?",
    "64:1": "Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,",
    "64:2": "as when fire kindleth the brushwood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!",
    "64:3": "When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.",
    "64:4": "For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.",
    "64:5": "Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them have we been of long time; and shall we be saved?",
    "64:6": "For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.",
    "64:7": "And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.",
    "64:8": "But now, O Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.",
    "64:9": "Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.",
    "64:10": "Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.",
    "65:1": "I am inquired of by them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.",
    "65:2": "I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;",
    "65:3": "a people that provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;",
    "65:4": "that sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;",
    "65:5": "that say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.",
    "65:6": "Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yea, I will recompense into their bosom,",
    "65:7": "your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.",
    "65:8": "Thus saith Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.",
    "65:9": "And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.",
    "65:10": "And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.",
    "65:11": "But ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny;",
    "65:12": "I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.",
    "65:13": "Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame;",
    "66:1": "Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what manner of house will ye build unto me? and what place shall be my rest?",
    "66:2": "For all these things hath my hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith Jehovah: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.",
    "66:3": "He that killeth an ox is as he that slayeth a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as he that breaketh a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as he that offereth swine's blood; he that burneth frankincense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations:",
    "66:4": "I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did that which was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not.",
    "66:5": "Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy; but it is they that shall be put to shame.",
    "66:6": "A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompense to his enemies.",
    "66:7": "Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.",
    "66:8": "Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.",
    "66:9": "Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy God.",
    "66:10": "Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her;",
    "66:11": "that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.",
    "66:12": "For thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream: and ye shall suck thereof; ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.",
    "66:13": "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.",
    "66:14": "And ye shall see it, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants; and he will have indignation against his enemies.",
    "66:15": "For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.",
    "66:16": "For by fire will Jehovah execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.",
    "66:17": "They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, saith Jehovah.",
    "66:18": "For I know their works and their thoughts: the time cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.",
    "66:19": "And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.",
    "66:20": "And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.",

    "52:19": "And the cups, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the bowls-that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,- the captain of the guard took away.",
    "52:20": "The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah-the brass of all these vessels was without weight.",
    "52:21": "And as for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.",
    "52:22": "And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like unto these, and pomegranates.",
    "52:23": "And there were ninety and six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.",
    "52:24": "And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:",
    "52:25": "and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war; and seven men of them that saw the king's face, that were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.",
    "52:26": "And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.",
    "52:27": "And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.",
    "52:28": "This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty;",
    "52:29": "in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons;",
    "52:30": "in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.",
    "52:31": "And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison;",
    "52:32": "and he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,",
    "52:33": "and changed his prison garments. And Jehoiachin did eat bread before him continually all the days of his life:",
    "52:34": "and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.",
    "3:52": "They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.",
    "3:53": "They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.",
    "3:54": "Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.",
    "3:55": "I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.",
    "3:56": "Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.",
    "3:57": "Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.",
    "3:58": "O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.",
    "3:59": "O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.",
    "3:60": "Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.",
    "3:61": "Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,",
    "3:62": "The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.",
    "3:63": "Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.",
    "3:64": "Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.",
    "3:65": "Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.",
    "3:66": "Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.",
    "16:51": "Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done.",
    "16:52": "Thou also, bear thou thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous that thou: yea, be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.",
    "16:53": "And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them;",
    "16:54": "that thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be ashamed because of all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.",
    "16:55": "And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.",
    "16:56": "For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,",
    "16:57": "before thy wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite unto thee round about.",
    "16:58": "Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith Jehovah.",
    "16:59": "For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also deal with thee as thou hast done, who hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.",
    "16:60": "Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.",
    "16:61": "Then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder sisters and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.",
    "16:62": "And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah;",
    "16:63": "that thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I have forgiven thee all that thou hast done, saith the Lord Jehovah.",
    "20:49": "Then said I, Ah Lord Jehovah! they say of me, Is he not a speaker of parables?",
    "23:45": "the sun's light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.",
    "23:46": "And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.",
    "23:47": "And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.",
    "23:48": "And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.",
    "23:49": "And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.",
    "40:39": "And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.",
    "40:40": "And on the one side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.",
    "40:41": "Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew the sacrifices.",
    "40:42": "And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.",
    "40:43": "And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.",
    "40:44": "And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.",
    "40:45": "And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;",
    "40:46": "and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.",
    "40:47": "And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.",
    "40:48": "Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.",
    "40:49": "The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.",
    "5:34": "But there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.",
    "5:35": "And he said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as touching these men, what ye are about to do.",
    "5:36": "For before these days rose up Theudas, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nought.",
    "5:37": "After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the enrolment, and drew away some of the people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.",
    "5:38": "And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown:",
    "5:39": "but if it is of God, ye will not be able to overthrow them; lest haply ye be found even to be fighting against God.",
    "5:40": "And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles unto them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.",
    "5:41": "They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.",
    "5:42": "And every day, in the temple and at home, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus as the Christ.",
    "5:43": "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.",
    "5:44": "How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not?",
    "5:45": "Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.",
    "5:46": "For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.",
    "5:47": "But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?",
    "5:48": "Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.",
    "21:46": "And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.",
    "26:66": "what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.",
    "26:67": "Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,",
    "26:68": "saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?",
    "26:69": "Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.",
    "26:70": "But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.",
    "26:71": "And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.",
    "26:72": "And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.",
    "26:73": "And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.",
    "26:74": "Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.",
    "26:75": "And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.",
    "27:47": "And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth Elijah.",
    "27:48": "And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.",
    "27:49": "And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.",
    "27:50": "And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.",
    "27:51": "And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent;",
    "27:52": "and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised;",
    "27:53": "and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.",
    "27:54": "Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.",
    "27:55": "And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:",
    "27:56": "among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.",
    "27:57": "And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:",
    "27:58": "this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.",
    "27:59": "And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,",
    "27:60": "and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.",
    "27:61": "And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.",
    "27:62": "Now on the morrow, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate,",
    "27:63": "saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.",
    "27:64": "Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.",
    "27:65": "Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it as sure as ye can.",
    "27:66": "So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.",
    "10:45": "And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.",
    "10:46": "For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,",
    "10:47": "Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?",
    "10:48": "And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.",
    "10:49": "And Jesus stood still, and said, Call ye him. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.",
    "10:50": "And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.",
    "10:51": "And Jesus answered him, and said, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.",
    "10:52": "And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And straightway he received his sight, and followed him in the way.",
    "14:58": "We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.",
    "14:59": "And not even so did their witness agree together.",
    "14:60": "And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?",
    "14:61": "But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?",
    "14:62": "And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.",
    "14:63": "And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses?",
    "14:64": "Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.",
    "14:65": "And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.",
    "14:66": "And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest;",
    "14:67": "and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, even Jesus.",
    "14:68": "But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.",
    "14:69": "And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.",
    "14:70": "But he again denied it. And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, of a truth thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilaean.",
    "14:71": "But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.",
    "14:72": "And straightway the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.",
    "1:55": "(As he spake unto our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever.",
    "1:56": "And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.",
    "1:57": "Now Elisabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.",
    "1:58": "And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.",
    "1:59": "And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.",
    "1:60": "And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.",
    "1:61": "And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.",
    "1:62": "And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.",
    "1:63": "And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.",
    "1:64": "And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, blessing God.",
    "1:65": "And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.",
    "1:66": "And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him.",
    "1:67": "And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,",
    "1:68": "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,",
    "1:69": "And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David",
    "1:70": "(As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),",
    "1:71": "Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;",
    "1:72": "To show mercy towards, our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;",
    "1:73": "The oath which he spake unto Abraham our father,",
    "1:74": "To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear,",
    "1:75": "In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.",
    "1:76": "Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High: For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways;",
    "1:77": "To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins,",
    "1:78": "Because of the tender mercy of our God, Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,",
    "1:79": "To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace.",
    "1:80": "And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.",
    "9:58": "And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.",
    "9:59": "And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.",
    "9:60": "But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.",
    "9:61": "And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.",
    "9:62": "But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.",
    "11:48": "If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.",
    "11:49": "But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,",
    "11:50": "nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.",
    "11:51": "Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;",
    "11:52": "and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.",
    "11:53": "So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.",
    "11:54": "Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.",
    "12:52": "for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.",
    "12:53": "They shall be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.",
    "12:54": "And he said to the multitudes also, When ye see a cloud rising in the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it cometh to pass.",
    "12:55": "And when ye see a south wind blowing, ye say, There will be a scorching heat; and it cometh to pass.",
    "12:56": "Ye hypocrites, ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time?",
    "12:57": "And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?",
    "12:58": "For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate, on the way give diligence to be quit of him; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge, and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer, and the officer shall cast thee into prison.",
    "12:59": "I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the very last mite.",
    "22:54": "And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off.",
    "22:55": "And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.",
    "22:56": "And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.",
    "22:57": "But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.",
    "22:58": "And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.",
    "22:59": "And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilaean.",
    "22:60": "But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.",
    "22:61": "And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.",
    "22:62": "And he went out, and wept bitterly.",
    "22:63": "And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and beat him.",
    "22:64": "And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee?",
    "22:65": "And many other things spake they against him, reviling him.",
    "22:66": "And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying,",
    "22:67": "If thou art the Christ, tell us. But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:",
    "22:68": "and if I ask you, ye will not answer.",
    "22:69": "But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God.",
    "22:70": "And they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.",
    "22:71": "And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.",
    "23:50": "And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man",
    "23:51": "(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), a man of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:",
    "23:52": "this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.",
    "23:53": "And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.",
    "23:54": "And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.",
    "23:55": "And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.",
    "23:56": "And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.",
